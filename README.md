# Recipe Website

This site is for people to view and create or delete their recipe online.

## User Story

- As a user I want to be able to check available recipe on the site and share my own recipe on there, If I made a mistake I would be either delete the post or edit the post

## Our Story
- We utilized nested components (index > card > buttons) and approached it by building a wireframe to agree on a layout, set a schedule of milestones to hit each day and divided the work by backend/frontend and then by component.  At first it was a problem getting the edit button to render changes on the browser on one click but we realized there was a missing prop needed to update the page.
